# Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments


This project performs sentiment analysis on YouTube video comments to gauge the general sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of viewers. The code is written in Python and utilizes several libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for natural language processing, and TextBlob for sentiment analysis. Comments are fetched using the YouTube Data API, requiring an API key for access. The project was developed in Visual Studio Code, making it easy to run and modify locally. This setup allows for the analysis of comments from any YouTube video by simply changing the video URL in the script.
